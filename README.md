# CourseReview Application

To run the CourseReview application, please follow these instructions:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Gradle installed on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://gradle.org/install/).

2. Clone the repository.

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to build the application:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

5. To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
java -jar ./build/libs/CourseReview.jar [-g|--gui|-c|--command]
```

This command will launch the application with either the GUI or the command line interface. Use the "-g" or "--gui" flag to launch the GUI interface, and use the "-c" or "--command" flag to launch the command line interface.

**Note:** Do not navigate into the build/libs directory first and then run java -jar. Instead, run the command from the main project directory following the instruction above.

6. Follow the instructions on the screen to use the application.
